# Rover-Controls-System-Status-Board

**Objective:**

Create a LED status board to display if other boards on the rover are working. All devices wired to this board will be outputting either a high or low signal. The LED board will output a green light if the signal is high and a red light if the signal is low. Power for this led will NOT be coming from the signal, it will be coming straight from the lowered voltage which came from the 12V line). There are 8 signals that will be sent to this board.
